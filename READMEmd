The current code is only some part of the whole pachisi game question created from scratch.
I used Three.js library to create the game.
The next steps I, completed adding the paths  , 
created the dice logic and the game rules logic for initial or starting point of the game 

Click the roll dice button on the page 4 times and wait for a second , it will then give a popup showing this player will play first as the player got total highest among all other players 
To know the position of the game pieces , the path is devided into planes and each one is given an id , eg-y0, y1,...
The sphere pieces are the game board objects for each player.
The current game board can be moved around as the orbital controls are added.
